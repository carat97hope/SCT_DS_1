TASK 01:  Population Visualization Task 

Task Overview
This task focuses on analyzing and visualizing global population data using Python. The objective is to explore population trends across countries and regions, and present meaningful insights through visualizations.

Dataset
Source: World Bank Population Dataset
Indicator: Population, total (SP.POP.TOTL)
Time Period: 1960 – 2022
Format: CSV file

Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas – for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
Matplotlib – for data visualization
Google Colab – for execution and analysis

Task Objectives
Load and preprocess population data
Handle missing values and clean columns
Analyze population distribution for the year 2022
Identify the top 10 most populous countries/regions
Visualize population patterns using charts

Visualizations Implemented
Histogram
Displays the distribution of population across countries in 2022
Helps understand population spread and skewness

Bar Chart
Shows the Top 10 Most Populous Countries/Regions (2022)
Enables easy comparison of population sizes

Key Outcomes
Successfully analyzed large-scale population data
Observed highly skewed population distribution
Identified major population contributors globally
Created clear and informative visualizations for insights
